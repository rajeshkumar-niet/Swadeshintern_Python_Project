# SwadeshIntern Python Projects

Welcome to my SwadeshIntern Python Projects repository! This repository contains the code and documentation for three projects that I completed as part of the SwadeshIntern internship program. These projects include a chat application, a currency converter, and a weather app.

## Project Details

### 1. Chat Application
- Description: A simple chat application that demonstrates basic server-client interaction using Python's socket library.
- Features:
  - Allows two or more users to chat with each other.
  - Includes a server and client component.
- Usage: You can run the server and client code to start a chat session.

### 2. Currency Converter
- Description: A currency conversion tool that converts between different currencies based on predefined exchange rates.
- Features:
  - Supports various currencies.
  - Provides real-time exchange rate data.
- Usage: Run the currency converter program and follow the prompts to convert currencies.

### 3. Weather App
- Description: A weather application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Features:
  - Retrieves weather information based on location.
  - Displays data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- Usage: Run the weather app and input the location for weather data retrieval.

## Getting Started
